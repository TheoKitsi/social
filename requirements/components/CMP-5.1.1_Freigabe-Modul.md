# CMP-5.1.1: Consent Module

## Functions

| FN-ID | Function |
|---|---|
| **FN-5.1.1.1** | The system shall display match proposals as anonymous profile previews containing only visibility level 2 (match preview) fields — name, exact location, photos, and level-1 fields remain hidden. Fields like age, core values, and relationship intention (level 2) are visible. (Details of visibility levels see SOL-16.) |
| **FN-5.1.1.2** | The system shall provide the options "Express interest" and "Decline" per match proposal. |
| **FN-5.1.1.3** | The system shall trigger a mutual reveal on bilateral interest and notify both users. |
| **FN-5.1.1.4** | The system shall release visibility level 3 profile fields (post-reveal) after reveal and activate the chat between both users. |
| **FN-5.1.1.5** | The system shall keep declines secret — the declined person must receive no hint, no feedback, and no notification about the decline. |
