- [ ] AC-7.1.4: The user can request a complete disclosure of all stored data at any time and export it (GDPR Art. 15).

- [ ] AC-7.1.6: All data accesses are logged and auditable.
- [ ] AC-7.1.7: Two-factor authentication is available and enforced for sensitive actions.
- [ ] AC-7.1.8: Suspicious activities (e.g. brute-force login, unusual location changes) are automatically detected.
