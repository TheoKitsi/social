# US-5.1: Mutual Interest Declaration Before Contact

> **As a** user **I want to** see a match proposal first as an anonymous preview and be able to express my interest **so that** contact only happens with mutual interest and I am protected from unwanted messages.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-5.1.1: Match proposals are shown as an anonymous preview — only visibility level 2 fields are visible.
- [ ] AC-5.1.2: The user can choose "Express interest" or "Decline" per match proposal.
- [ ] AC-5.1.3: Only when both sides express interest is a mutual reveal triggered.
- [ ] AC-5.1.4: After reveal, additional profile fields (visibility level 3) become visible and the chat is activated.
- [ ] AC-5.1.5: Declines are never communicated to the other person — no feedback, no hint.
- [ ] AC-5.1.6: The chat is end-to-end encrypted.
- [ ] AC-5.1.7: Users can report or block other users at any time.
- [ ] AC-5.1.8: A block immediately prevents all contact and permanently removes the profile from the blocked user's matching list.

## Components

- CMP-5.1.1: Consent Module
- CMP-5.1.2: Communication Module
