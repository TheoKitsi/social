# CMP-9.1.1: Match Transparency Module

## Functions

| FN-ID | Function |
|---|---|
| **FN-9.1.1.1** | The system shall display a category-wise compatibility breakdown per match proposal — organized by funnel levels and subcategories (e.g. "Values: 98%", "Lifestyle: 87%", "Future planning: 91%"). |
| **FN-9.1.1.2** | The system shall visually highlight fulfilled and unfulfilled deal-breakers (e.g. green check for passed, orange warning for borderline). |
| **FN-9.1.1.3** | The system shall summarize and display the top 3 commonalities and top 3 differences between the two profiles in text form. |
| **FN-9.1.1.4** | The system shall accompany the overall score with a qualitative assessment (e.g. "Very high compatibility", "Strong basis", "Good basis with differences in details"). |
| **FN-9.1.1.5** | The system shall not display categories in the breakdown that contain exclusively level-1 fields — their compatibility only flows into the overall score without becoming visible as a separate row. This prevents indirect inferences about sensitive level-1 data. (-> SOL-16, FN-16.1.1.5) |
