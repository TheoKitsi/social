# BC-1: Business Case — Long-Term Relationship Dating Platform

> **Version**: 1.0
> **Date**: 2026-03-10
> **Status**: Approved

---

## 1. Vision

This platform is for people who are **genuinely** searching for a life partner.

Like any major life decision — housing, career, commitment — the search begins with **self-awareness and clarity**, not a swipe to the right. The funnel model guides users systematically from foundational values to the most personal details — including quirks, idiosyncrasies, and vulnerabilities. Anyone unwilling to look honestly at who they are and what they need does not belong here.

**Seriousness as a filter.**

---

## 2. Business Case

The platform enables verified users to receive high-quality match proposals with strong compatibility by providing detailed information about themselves and their ideal partner, leading to voluntary and serious connections.

### Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Funnel Model** | From broad to fine — 5 levels, mandatory levels cannot be skipped |
| **Self-Awareness** | Users must know who they are before they can search |
| **Honesty** | Including quirks, idiosyncrasies, vulnerabilities — everything a partner should know |
| **Deceleration** | Limited, curated proposals instead of endless swiping |
| **Mutuality** | No contact without mutual interest |
| **Transparency** | Every match is explained — "Why this person?" |
| **Privacy** | Sensitive data is protected, visibility controlled by the user |

### Monetization

| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| **Subscription** | Monthly / annual subscriptions with tiered feature sets |
| **Pay-per-Action** | Individual transactions for profile changes, extra match quotas, premium features |

---

## 3. Funnel Model (5 Levels)

The heart of the platform. Each level has **two sides**: "Who am I?" + "Who am I looking for?".
Levels 1-3 are mandatory and sequential — the next level only opens when the previous one is complete.

| Level | Status | Theme | Analogy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | MANDATORY | **Foundation** — Basic data, relationship intention, core values | "Vehicle category?" / "Apartment or house?" |
| **2** | MANDATORY | **Character & Lifestyle** — Personality, daily life, habits, religion | "Brand, size, color" / "District, floor, balcony" |
| **3** | MANDATORY | **Future & Goals** — Desire for children, life plan, career, finances | "Engine, transmission, mileage" / "Lease term, finish standard" |
| **4** | OPTIONAL | **Depth** — Hobbies, sexuality, quirks, idiosyncrasies, vulnerabilities | "Special equipment" / "Smart home, sauna, fireplace" |
| **5** | OPTIONAL | **Fine-Tuning** — Niche topics, cultural details, micro-preferences | "Leather color, wheel type" / "Underfloor heating, window handles" |
