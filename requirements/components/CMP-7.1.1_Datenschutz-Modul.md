# CMP-7.1.1: Data Protection Module

## Functions

| FN-ID | Function |
|---|---|
| **FN-7.1.1.1** | The system shall encrypt all personal data at rest (AES-256 or equivalent) and in transit (TLS 1.3+). |
| **FN-7.1.1.2** | The system shall assign every data processing operation to a clearly defined, documented purpose and not process data beyond the defined purpose (GDPR purpose limitation). |
| **FN-7.1.1.3** | The system shall obtain granular consents per processing purpose (e.g. matching, image analysis, marketing); each consent is individually revocable. |
| **FN-7.1.1.4** | The system shall provide a complete disclosure of all stored personal data on request and enable export in a machine-readable format (e.g. JSON). |
| **FN-7.1.1.5** | The system shall completely and irreversibly remove all personal data on account deletion, including images, chat histories, and matching data; statutory retention obligations remain unaffected. |
| **FN-7.1.1.6** | The system shall log all accesses to personal data (who, when, what, why) and retain these logs for audits. |
