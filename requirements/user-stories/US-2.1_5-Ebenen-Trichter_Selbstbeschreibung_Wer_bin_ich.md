# US-2.1: 5-Level Funnel Self-Description "Who Am I?"

> **As a** verified user **I want to** describe myself in a structured 5-level funnel in detail — from foundation to the most personal level — **so that** the system knows me as well as possible and can propose only truly compatible partners.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-2.1.1: The self-description is divided into 5 clearly separated levels.
- [ ] AC-2.1.2: Levels 1-3 are mandatory and must be fully completed before the user appears in the matching pool.
- [ ] AC-2.1.3: Level N+1 is only unlocked when Level N is fully completed.
- [ ] AC-2.1.4: Levels 4-5 are optional but increase the profile quality score.
- [ ] AC-2.1.5: Each level offers a mix of structured fields (dropdown, slider, multi-select) and free-text fields.
- [ ] AC-2.1.6: Progress per level is visually indicated (progress bar).
