# CMP-6.1.1: Change Management Module

## Functions

| FN-ID | Function |
|---|---|
| **FN-6.1.1.1** | The system shall lock core profile fields (levels 1-3 mandatory fields) after initial population and prevent changes by default. |
| **FN-6.1.1.2** | The system shall release locked fields for change only against a defined fee (pay-per-action) or within the subscription quota. |
| **FN-6.1.1.3** | The system shall allow limited free changes per time period (configurable, e.g. 1 core field change per quarter). |
| **FN-6.1.1.4** | The system shall trigger a re-verification for changes to security-relevant fields (name, location, gender) before the change takes effect. |
| **FN-6.1.1.5** | The system shall record all profile changes in an internal change log (timestamp, changed field, old/new value — viewable only by administrators). |
